# FCDataFitter
#### Data Fitting Toolbox Employing Fractional Calculus 

### Way to Go

It started from an idea, find a better formulation for MOND  
Next I thought about how to do data fitting using Fractional Calculus  
Next found the FC regression Analytically solving differential equations is a big pain  
Finding ways to automate the FC regression problem might help in lots of areas.

* First, we need a way to plot the given data and guess its polynomial fit to set a limit on the order of Fractional Regression
* Next write suitable FC differential regression equations and find appropriate parameters  
* Finally solve the equation or plot the solution if the analytical solution is hard or nearly impossible.
